Being part of the developer ecosystem, we're aware about platforms like GitHub, Bitbucket, etc. to come up and exhibit our projects. However, 'Learning in Public' is a bigger picture here. It's about sharing your day-to-day journey at each step instead simply displaying the final project.

But why do we need it? Does it really make a difference? How do we 'Learn in Public' exactly? Is it really that relevant for developers?

## What's Public Learning?

In the simplest words, it means to document or post your entire journey of learning a skill, or developing a project everyday on public platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, etc.

The main aim is to essentially share about it via a normal post, and simultaneously get in connection with the developers and seniors who you look upto. It's that simple!

## Reasons to start learning in public

As developers, we are self-learners most of the time. That instead gives a more valid reason to opt for 'Learning in Public'.
