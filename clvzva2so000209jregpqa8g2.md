> This write-up is focused on readers who have questions like:
> 
> a) Should I switch language from JavaScript to be in the tech-trend?
> 
> b) Why should I learn JavaScript?
> 
> d) I'm a beginner, what programming language is the best to learn?
> 
> d) I've got a specific tech stack, shall I still stick to JavaScript?

Here are suitable examples to prove how and why JavaScript happens to be the subject of this decade and trendsetter. Not to miss mentioning, most of the companies use this language as either for 'specific functionalities' or for the 'entire tech stack'.

---

# Reason : 1 - Easy to Learn

The first reason goes for all the beginners out there, who wishes to kickstart to learn JavaScript, as their very first language.

Also, most people usually start learning computer science with the 'basics of programming'. Which potentially is good- to start the programming fundamentals with any C-based languages.

In both the cases, the <mark>overall syntax</mark> of JavaScript is pretty easy to adapt. So, practice JavaScript, because it's easy!

---

# Reason : 2 - Use-case it carries

You just need to select what you'd like to work on.

1. Vanilla JavaScript - helps you work on simple projects!
    
2. ReactJS - for building complex projects!
    
3. React Native - for constructing a mobile app!
    
4. Electron.js - to build any client app!
    
5. Tensorflow.js - helps in Machine Learning/AI based apps!
    
6. Node.js - builds the backend framework for you!
    
7. Web3.js - gets you to create dApp!
    
8. Jest - allows you to go for testing!
    
9. JSDoc - to work on documentation!
    

So, JavaScript is essentially a precious skill for the developers looking to work across <mark>different domains</mark>.

It supports development with its extensive collection of libraries, and frameworks (like React, Vue.js, Angular, etc). Mic drop!!! ü´≥üé§

# Reason : 3 - Acceptable to job roles

The very good reason to start this is companies like Google, Meta, Netflix, all of them rely on JavaScript on either of the above cases. So, stop thinking it's only for web-development, while you actually can practice <mark>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms with JavaScript</mark>!

If not so, <mark>freelancing</mark> with JavaScript is again the most acceptable option, when it comes down to create front-end websites, working on backend framework, building in <mark>Web3</mark>, or else delivering any <mark>full-stack projects</mark>!

Yes, JavaScript gives you the flexibility!

---

# Reason : 4 - Global community support

JavaScript has been used by millions of developers worldwide, including students, researchers, educators, and professionals.

You definitely got a good chance to learn a beginner-friendly language with the most curated content including tutorials, documentation, video tutorials, and courses, to learn from. It's always a win-win with this huge <mark>community, worldwide</mark>.

# Reason : 5 - Animation language

JavaScript is certainly a game changer when it comes to building custom UI <mark>animations</mark>, and <mark>smooth functionalities</mark>. So, it can do a lot more than what `@keyframes` does in CSS.

Also, there are some important libraries like [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://gsap.com/) and Anime.js to help you with the sleekest pre-made animations.

Hence, in the aspect of an MVP (minimum viable product) JavaScript can enhance the <mark>User Experience</mark> by a whole bigger ratio, when used to its potential.

JavaScript carries a huge potential for the developer ecosystem, and it's pretty evident too. It might not be the only language you learn, but it certainly should be tried once! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Happy Scripting!!
